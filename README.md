## QIDI 3d printer definitions for Cura

These definitions were extracted from the proprietary software (a hack of cura) that shipped with my X-plus. Put them in /usr/share/cura/resources/definitions (on Linux), restart Cura and they will appear in the configuration menus.

DISCLAIMER: I MAKE NO GUARANTEES THAT THESE FILES ARE CORRECT AND WON'T HARM YOUR PRINTER OR DO ANYTHING ELSE YOU DON'T LIKE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

DISCLAIMER 2: THESE CONFIGS MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME IF QIDI FEELS LIKE CHANGING THEM AND SHIPPING NEW VERSIONS WITH NEW PRODUCTS. I DON'T PLAN ON ATTEMPTING TO KEEP UP WITH THESE CHANGES. THESE FILES CAME FROM AN X-PLUS PURCHASED IN OCTOBER 2019 FROM AMAZON.
